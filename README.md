# MorseCoder

Morse Coder is my contribution to CST8333 Programming Language Research Project at Algonquin College. It is my introduction to programming in Python. 

This program accepts user input as a text message and converts it into Morse code represented as dash-dot character notation or audible beeps. Simple but effective!
